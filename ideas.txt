To maintain low viral loads and optimal health, patients should:
Adhere strictly to antiretroviral therapy (ART)39.
Attend regular clinic appointments for monitoring and support6.
Communicate openly with healthcare providers about side effects or challenges6.
Practice safe sex and avoid sharing personal items like toothbrushes or razors

Healthcare providers can support patients in maintaining low viral loads by:
Educating patients about the importance of medication adherence39.
Helping patients develop a medication routine and offering adherence support3.
Addressing side effects promptly to ensure continued treatment6.
Utilizing mobile communication technologies for reminders and support7.
Offering counseling services, both individual and group-based


This feature would make it a hybrid monitoring + decision-support tool, which is less common.


Add a doctor-facing dashboard where providers can:
See aggregated patient adherence/viral suppression trends.
Receive alerts for patients at risk of treatment failure.
Review model-generated regimen recommendations.

Reward users for consistent check-ins, adherence, or achieving health milestones (e.g., "10 days of perfect adherence" badges).
